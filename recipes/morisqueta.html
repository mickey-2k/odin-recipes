        <ol>
            <li>Take the tomato and cook it on low heat, turning occassionaly until each side is 
                black and the tomato is squishy to the touch
            </li>
            <li>Do the same thing with the chili peppers as with the tomatoes, crisping them up a bit
                (If you want the dish to be less spicy take out the seeds)
            </li>
            <li>Put the chilis and tomatoes in a blender and add some water. Proceed to blend until 
                the mixture is smooth
            </li>
            <li>Set chili aside and proceed to rinse rice</li>
            <li>Thinly slice half a quarter of the onion</li>
            <li>Add rice and fill up with a ration of 1.5 water to rice. Add the onion slices and 
                let it begin to cook
            </li>
            <li>(Skip if not making with meat) Add water, meat, and bay leaves to a pot.
                Add salt and let simmer until almost fully cooked through
            </li>
            <li>Juliene the rest of the onion and mince the garlic</li>
            <li>Boil the pinto beans with a pinch of salt. Once fully cooked, move just the
                beans into the pan and add some manteca. Coook over medium heat until soft
            </li>
            <li>Mash the beans when soft enough and add some of the bean juice to make the beans
                a smoother consistency then set aside
            </li>
            <li>At this point, the meat should be just about done. Remove most of the water and the
                bay leaves from the pot of meat. Add the chili sauce and onion slices and let simmer
                over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>If using cheese, add cheese cut into cubes and allow to simmer in the sauce over medium heat</li>
            <li>Once the meat is fully cooked and the onions are softened, you can begin plating</li>
            <li>Make sure to begin with the rice base and add the beans and chili sauce on top. After you
                can add the Mexican crema and cheese toppings. Enjoy!
