    <!-- A brief description of the recipe -->
        <p>These tacos are a staple food for many people throughout the USA.
            Many of the best places where these tacos can be purchased is in small
            shops found along the streets of Mexican communities and areas with high
            foot traffic. Tacos like these are delicious to eat alone or share with friends.

            The following recipe will try to recreate the feeling that is brought about when visiting these
            establishments. Fresh ingredients are a must for this recipe and it cannot be stressed that besides
            the meat, what really makes the tacos are the toppings that you add to it. And don't forget to buy
            yourself a nice refreshing drink to wash down these bad boys after all the work you put in!
